This is a clone of the shadcn/ui documentation site built with the latest Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Introduction

shadcn/ui is a collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It's not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.

## FAQ

<details>
 <summary>Why not packaged as a dependency?</summary>
 
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code.

You can decide how the components work, fix bugs yourself, and add the features you need based on your requirements.

One of the drawbacks of installing components as dependencies is that you lose the ability to adapt and customize them to your specific needs. You're also adding bloat to your applications by bringing in code you're not using.
